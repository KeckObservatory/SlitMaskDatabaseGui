<h3><u>Mask Submission</u></h3>
<br>

<form id="maskSubmitForm" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <!-- Wrap file input and submit button in a flex container -->
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <!-- File input -->
    <input type="file" name="maskFile" size="80" multiple=""/>
    <!-- Submit button -->
    <button type="button" onclick="submitMask()" id="submitMaskBtn">Submit</button>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <hr />
  <!-- Additional content -->
  <p>
    Reminder: Keck Observatory requires that all masks be submitted <strong>four weeks</strong> before the date of observing. Masks with unusually complex design may need to be submitted earlier; check with the Instrument Scientist at Keck for more details.
  </p>
</form>

<h3><u>DEIMOS</u></h3>
<p>
  A DEIMOS mask design file must be a multi-extension FITS file containing
  several tables which describe a desired slitmask.  Such a FITS file will
  typically have been created by the
  <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~phillips/deimos_ref/masks.html#tools">DSIMULATOR</a> program.
  The new software is the
  <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/realpublic/inst/deimos/smdt.html">SlitMask Design Tool (SMDT)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>DEIMOS users take note:</b> The e-mail addresses for the mask design author and the
    mask observer must be a valid Keck Observer Account email address.
</p>

<h3><u>LRIS</u></h3>
<p>
    LRIS users may submit ASCII mask design files created by either of two means.

        <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/lris/lrishome.html">AUTOSLIT</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This program is by Cohen, Shopbell, et al.  It should be
        <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~pls/autoslit/">available from Caltech</a>.
        <br/>
        Note that neither Keck nor UCO/Lick has control nor detailed knowledge of the operation of AUTOSLIT.
        <br/>
        The AUTOSLIT program produces multiple output files, and we are not aware of a canonical nomenclature
        scheme for distinguishing the various output files. There is also no clear indication of which file
        is which in the content of the headers of the output files from AUTOSLIT.
        <br/>
        The output file that is needed for slitmask manufacture seems to be associated with a character
        string something like <tt>file3</tt> in the setup for AUTOSLIT. This file is the one which contains
        multiple rows of mill coordinates for slitlets which are separated by lines containing the word
        <tt>newrow</tt>.
        <br/>
        Please submit only this one kind of output from AUTOSLIT; i.e., the file containing the slitlet
        milling coordinates.

        This program is by Phillips. It should be available from UCO/Lick.

<p>
    <b>LRIS users take note:</b>
    The GUINAMEs which will be used for milling and selection
    of the masks are created using the first 8 characters of
    the file names used in the entry box below).
    Those 8 characters for the GUINAME for all masks must be
    unique, and duplicate names will be mangled in an attempt
    to ensure uniqueness.
    Until further notice the only control that LRIS users have
    over the GUINAME is to name the input files according to
    these conventions.
