    <b>Mask Status</b>

      <li>
        <b>UNMILLED</b>
        <p class="help-idented">
          The inital status of a mask upon submission is UNMILLED.
          A mask design that is UNMILLED means that either (1) a mask has not been created for
          the mask,  or (2) the mask created has been archived and the design has
          been set to be re-milled.  A design with status = UNMILLED will be available in the
          milling queue.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>READY</b>
        <p class="help-idented">
          A mask design that is READY has an associated mask that was milled and is available
          for observing.  A READY mask is on Maunakea summit is either
          in the instrument or available to be installed in the instrument.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ARCHIVED</b>
        <p class="help-idented">
        An ARCHIVED mask design means the design will not be used to create a mask.
        If a mask has been created that mask is now archived (recycled) and no longer
        available for use.  To observe with an ARCHIVED mask design,  the mask
        must be set to 'RE-MILL',  which will bring the
        design back into the milling queue.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>
    <b>Archive</b>
  </li>

  <p class="help-idented">
    The ARCHIVE button will mark masks as ARCHIVED.  The meaning of archived is that the
    mask is no longer READY for observing.  If it was milled,  the physical metal mask
    is no longer available for use.

    To move a mask design from ARCHIVED to READY,  the mask must be set to RE-MILL and
    a new mask will be created at the CNC mill.
  </p><br>

  <li>
    <b>Auto Archiving</b>
  </li>
  <p class="help-idented">
    Mask designs are automatically archived if they are 6 months past their use-date.
    Once the mask design is marked as archived, the mask will be removed from
    Maunakea summit and no longer be available for use. An email is sent to the PI
    2 weeks before the mask is archived to warn the PI of this process,  at this point
    they have the ability to update the use-date saving the mask from the recycle pile.
  </p><br>

  <li>
    <b>Remill</b>
  </li>
  <p class="help-idented">
    The REMILL functionality allows
    a mask design to be sent to the milling queue.  If an archived mask design needs to
    be used again,  a new mask can be milled from the design by marking it to
    be remilled.  Contact an Support Astronomer or coversheet@keck.hawaii.edu regarging
    the mask milling process.

  <li>
    <b>Plot</b>

  </li>

  <p class="help-idented">
    The Plot button produces a graphical representation of the mask design.
  </p><br>

  <li>
    <b>FITS file</b>
  </li>

  <p class="help-idented">

    The FITS file generates a 'FITS chunk' for any
    mask design. This can take a while to generate and is not useful unless you
    already know what it is.
  </p><br>

  <li>
    <b>Detail</b>
  </li>

  <p class="help-idented">
    The Detail button shows all the data contained in the
    mask design and blueprint.
