<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Forget</b>
  </li>

  <p class="indented">
    The Forget button is DANGEROUS. It causes the blueprint to be forgotten
    as if it had never been submitted. This is a good feature when you have
    submitted a mask you didn't mean to submit, or when you need to revise a
    design and prevent the original version from being milled. Mask blueprints
    that have been forgotten will not show up in the inventory. To 'unforget'
    the blueprint, you will need the help of a wizard.

  <li>
    <b>Remill</b>
  </li>

  <p class="indented">
    After being milled, masks are marked 'done' so that they do not pop up
    again in the 'to be milled' list. To make another copy of a mask that
    has been milled already, you will need to mark it 'unmilled' using the
    Remill button.

    NOTE: It is a Bad Idea to use the Remill button to re-use a slitmask from
    a previous run. The Observing Date will be past and the slitmask milling
    work queue will reject it. Instead we recommend you (a) regenerate the
    design file using DSIMULATOR or equivalent, and submit the revised version,
    or (b) edit the MDF (FITS file output from DSIMULATOR) and resubmit it with
    the corrected observing date. See Mask Dates Help for tips on this.

  <li>
      <b>Plot</b>

  </li>

  <p class="indented">
    The Plot button is not dangerous. It produces a graphical representation of
    the mask design.
  </p>

  <li>
    <b>FITS file</b>
  </li>

  <p class="indented">

    The FITS file button is not dangerous. It generates a 'FITS chunk' for any
    mask design. This can take a while to generate and is not useful unless you
    already know what it is :-)
  </p><br>

  <li>
    <b>Detail</b>
  </li>

  <p class="indented">
    The Detail button is not dangerous. It shows all the data contained in the
    mask design and blueprint(s).
